            <p>For most of my professional life, I’ve been working as a percussionist, music educator, arranger, and music-communicator. As a performer, I specialize in jazz vibraphone (a xylophone-like instrument with metal bars and a sustain pedal) as well as marching and concert percussion. As an educator, the bulk of my experience has been as a percussion instructor. In particular, I’ve been fortunate to work for a few highly respected, nationally-competitive performing arts organizations: Phantom Regiment Drum & Bugle Corps, Matrix Performing Arts, and O’Fallon Township High School. These are three organizations whose marching music ensembles not only consistently push creative boundaries, but who also compete at the highest possible levels of their respective circuits (Drum Corps International, Winter Guard International, and Bands of America). I’ve been lucky to learn from and teach alongside countless incredible musicians and creative thinkers with these organizations.

            <p>In 2021, I’ve started down a new path by enrolling in devCodeCamp’s Full-Stack Software Development program. It’s a big change, but I’m extremely excited to take my experiences as a musician and apply what I’ve learned to the world of software development. Musicians are creative problem-solvers, and so are developers. I’m ready to swap out one set of problems for another, but I know that the way I think about them won’t change.

            <p>My fiancé and I currently live in St. Louis, Missouri with our two cats, Lentil and Noodle. We’ll be relocating to Philadelphia, PA in July of 2021, and we can’t wait to see what’s next.</p>
